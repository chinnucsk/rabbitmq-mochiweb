rabbitmq-mochiweb
--------

rabbitmq-mochiweb is a thin veneer around mochiweb that provides the ability
for multiple RabbitMQ plugins to co-exist under a single web-app root. Applications
can register static docroots along with dynamic handlers to be executed based on
various incoming request properties.

Note that the version of mochiweb built by rabbit-mochiweb depends on
features introduced in Erlang R13A.

Environment Variables
---------------------

rabbitmq-mochiweb uses the standard OTP environment variables mechanism. It understands
these variables:

* port -       The port to listen on (by default 55672);

Installation
------------

After you've successfully run make on the plugin, the plugin can be installed by copying
both mochiweb.ez and rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez to your Rabbit installation's plugins directory,
then executing rabbitmq-activate-plugins.

Configuration
-------------

As indicated in the Environment Variables section, the rabbitmq-mochiweb plugin supports
OTP application configuration values. These values can be set as either Erlang startup
parameters or via the rabbitmq.config file, with a block such as:
  {rabbit_mochiweb, [{port, 8080}]}
